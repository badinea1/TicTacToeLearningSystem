# Description: A writeup reflecting on the assignment.

(1) Anything positive you enjoyed or learned from this assignment
	We enjoyed implementing what was learned in class. We developed a deeper understanding of the LMS learning algorithm, as well as how to teach 
	a machine to learn a game like tic tac toe.
(2) Anything negative you didn't like about this assignment
	- Nothing
(3) Any parts of this assignment you found easy
	- None
(4) Any parts of this assignment you found challenging or couldn't get working correctly
	- Adjusting the weights was at first challenging, though we were able to overcome this. At some point, our ratio of games won and games lost was 
	very close. For example, at some point we had X winning 3017 games and O winning 2104 and we tied 4879 times, and we realized 
	that the issue was with the LMS code, as we forgot to implement a w0 weight and edited our chooseMove function to evaluate the best move based on 
	the successor. Once that was added, the ratio changed significantly as X won around 9688 games while O won 302 games, with 10 games tied.
	Therefore, we found that this signifcantly helped our learning algorithm.
	
(5) How the team functioned:
	- The team functioned by communicating through GroupMe and meeting several times a week. Regular Zoom meetings were held to brainstorm and design
	the code and to review the progress. We split the work among us evenly.

	What each team member contributed:
	- Amulya: Implemented the LMS Weight Update Rule and the function to extract training data from games played, designed gameplay 
		between learner and opponent, debugged the code, worked on the write-up.
	- Adeena: Made functions to get successive board states, retrieve features from board state, and created Player functions (excluding LMS and chooseMove),
	debugged code, and worked on write-up.
	- Suada: Created functions to generate the board, debugged the code and analyzed for errors, helped with plotting and the write-up.
	- Lana: Analyzed the code for errors, debugged the code, cleaned up code added documentation. Additionally worked on the plots and the write-up. 

	How the team communicated with each other:
	- GroupMe was used for immediate communication and to decide when Zoom meetings would be held.
	- Zoom was used for longer meetings and to discuss the current state of the project and how to progress.
	
	How team software development & design was accomplished
	- During the first Zoom meeting, we were all prepared to brainstorm and discuss which features we would want to use. In addition, we assigned parts of
	the design we wanted each group member to work on. As for software development, a group member would finish their task and commit it to GitHub, and then
	the team would come together to evaluate the code.
	 
(6) Any other remarks you want to make
	- None
